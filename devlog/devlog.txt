  Technical assessment was recieved, and I forked the repo to be able to work on my own version of the assessment. Started reading up on Node.JS, Angular 2+, and Postman as I only have experience with Node.JS and Postman from the Authentication and Authorization presentation that Paige Zalepaa did for the Software Engineering Club.

  Cloned the repository to VSCode to be able to learn how to better do commits as in the past I used gitHub somewhat improperly by mostly just uploading files straight to gitHub or editing the files using the gitHub editor through their website.
  I have gotten the Backend API working with the message "Welcome to the Backend API!" displaying when you navigate to "localhost:3000". I have looked through the technical-assessment/backend/src files and I definitely need to do more reading into Javascript and Node.JS to be able to effectively write the code asked for.
